# Circular Queue Implementation in C++

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of the **Circular Queue** data structure in C++. A circular queue is a variation of a regular queue where the last element is connected back to the first element, forming a circle. This ensures efficient use of memory by reusing the space that becomes available when elements are dequeued.

## Features
- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the queue.
- **Front/Rear**: Access the front and rear elements of the queue.
- **Check if the queue is empty or full**.

## Usage
In the main file, you can modify the code to perform operations like enqueue and dequeue. Here's a simple usage example:
